# YoloDeploy

YoloDeploy aims to deploy Yolo-series models, including
Yolov3, YoloV4, Yolov5, etc.
The deployment methods include `Pytorch`, `Libtorch`, `OpenCV DNN`, 
`TensorRT`, `OpenVino`, `ncnn`, `darknet` and so on.

I wrote this project to get familiar with Yolo Deployment,
and also to share and learn from the community.
